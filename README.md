# Cooktails

[Cooktails](https://ben-cook.github.io/cooktails/#/) is a web app that serves all your cocktail needs. It was created as my entry to CISSA's Winterhack 2021 Hackathon. All data is sourced from https://www.thecocktaildb.com but uses the custom-made [cooktails-db](https://github.com/ben-cook/cooktails-db) backend server.
